# Student Grade Generator, Speed Detector, and Net Salary Calculator

## Overview
This repository contains three JavaScript solutions:
1. **Student Grade Generator** - Determines a student's grade based on marks.
2. **Speed Detector** - Checks a driver's speed and assigns demerit points.
3. **Net Salary Calculator** - Computes an individual's net salary after tax and deductions.

## Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator
- Inputs student marks (0-100) and outputs a grade:
  - A: >79, B: 60-79, C: 50-59, D: 40-49, E: <40.
- Example:
  Input: 85
  Output: Grade: A
  

## Challenge 2: Speed Detector
- Checks car speed:
  - <=70km/h: "Ok"
  - Every 5 km/h over 70: +1 demerit point
  - 12 points: "License suspended"


## Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
- Calculates:
  - **Gross Salary** = Basic Salary + Benefits
  - **Deductions**: Payee (KRA), NHIF, NSSF
  - **Net Salary** = Gross Salary - Deductions
